# ThinkCPP, a game perspective

Originally based on Text and code for Think C++ by Allen Downey

This project is taking the great book by Allen Downey and adding more modern C++ to the explanations and examples. In addition, most of the examples will be changing to be more based on games. New examples and sections are written by Lisa Patacchiola
